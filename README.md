# Optimisation-methods-for-Image-Classification
This is a image classification project that builds a logistic regression model from scratch.

This project uses Python's JAX library.

In this project, we made use of baseline logistic regression for the classification task. We utilised various approaches like image pre-processing, isolation of features, stochastic gradient descent with momentum and regularisation to optimise the prediction performance. For further details, refer to the written report in `report/final report`.
