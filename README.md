# Optimisation-methods-for-Image-Classification

This project uses Python's JAX library.

In this project, we made use of baseline logistic regression for the classification task. We utilised various approaches like image pre-processing, isolation of features, stochastic gradient descent with momentum and regularisation to optimise the prediction performance. For further details, refer to the written report in `report/final report`.
